# Google AdSense Review Process - What to Expect

## The Process

### Step 1: Add Your Site to AdSense
You need to **explicitly add** `links.patreek.com` to your AdSense account. Just having the code on your site isn't enough - you must add it in the AdSense dashboard.

### Step 2: Google Shows Review Status
Once you add the site, Google will show you the review status. You should see:

**In AdSense Dashboard:**
- **"Sites"** section will show your site
- Status will be one of:
  - 🟡 **"Getting ready"** - Site added, waiting for review
  - 🟡 **"Needs attention"** - Issues found, action required
  - 🟢 **"Ready"** - Approved! Ads can be shown
  - 🔴 **"Not approved"** - Rejected (with reasons)

### Step 3: Review Timeline
- **Initial review**: Usually 1-3 days
- **Can take up to**: 2 weeks
- **You'll get**: Email notifications about status changes

## How to Add Your Site

### Method 1: Through "Sites" Section
1. In AdSense dashboard, look for **"Sites"** in left sidebar
   - It might be under **"Account"** → **"Sites"**
   - Or it might be a top-level menu item
2. Click **"Sites"**
3. Click **"Add site"** or **"+"** button
4. Enter: `https://links.patreek.com`
5. Click **"Add"**

### Method 2: Through Account Settings
1. Click **"Account"** in left sidebar
2. Look for **"Sites"** or **"Site management"**
3. Click **"Add site"**
4. Enter your URL

### Method 3: Look for Notifications
1. Check the main dashboard for any cards/notifications
2. Look for messages like "Add your first site" or "Get started"
3. Click through to add your site

## What You'll See After Adding Site

### Immediately After Adding:
- Site appears in "Sites" list

- You can check back anytime to see status

### After Approval:

## Current Situation

**What We've Done:**
✅ AdSense verification code in `<head>` tag  
✅ Privacy Policy page created  
✅ Footer with Privacy Policy link  

**What's Missing:**
❌ Site not yet added to AdSense account  
❌ That's why you don't see "Ads" section  
❌ That's why you don't see review status  

## Action Items

1. **Find "Sites" in AdSense dashboard**
   - Check left sidebar
   - Check under "Account" menu
   - Look for any "Add site" buttons

2. **Add `https://links.patreek.com`**
   - Google will detect the AdSense code automatically
   - May ask for additional verification (HTML tag or DNS)

3. **Monitor Review Status**
   - Check "Sites" section regularly
   - You'll see status updates there
   - You'll get email notifications

4. **After Approval**
   - "Ads" section will appear
   - Create ad units
   - Get ad slot IDs
   - Update code

## Important Notes

- **You MUST add the site manually** - Google won't automatically detect it just from the code
- **Review status is visible** - You'll see it in the "Sites" section
- **You'll get notifications** - Email updates about approval status
- **The code we added** helps Google verify ownership faster

## If You Still Can't Find "Sites"

Try these:
1. **Search in AdSense**: Use the search bar, type "sites" or "add site"
2. **Check Account menu**: Expand "Account" → look for site-related options
3. **Check top bar**: Look for a "+" or "Add" button
4. **Contact AdSense support**: If you can't find it, there might be an account issue

The key point: **You need to actively add your site to AdSense**. The code alone isn't enough - Google needs you to tell them "this is my site" through the dashboard.
